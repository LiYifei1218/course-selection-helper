E62 BME 220	Introduction to Biomedical Circuits	4.0 Units	Electricity is central to normal and abnormal biological function, spanning scales from the subcellular to whole systems. Scientists and engineers also use electrical engineering to design and implement interaction with biological tissue, from classical physiological experiments to cutting-edge brain-computer interfaces. This course will begin study of bioelectrical engineering, by introducing simple electrical elements, circuits, amplifiers, and instrumentation. Relevant biological examples and computer modeling will be used throughout. Prerequisite: BME 140	"Annually / "	null	null
E62 BME 240	Biomechanics	3.0 Units	Principles of static equilibrium and solid mechanics applied to the human anatomy and a variety of biological problems. Statics of rigid bodies with applications to the musculoskeletal system. Mechanics of deformable media (stress, strain; stretching, torsion, and bending) with introduction to nonlinear behavior, viscoelasticity, and growth in living tissue. Applications to cells, bone, muscle, arteries, the heart, and the cochlea.  Prerequisites: Phys 117A or 197	"Annually / "	BME 220,BME 231	null
E62 BME 231	Foundations of Biomedical Computing	3.0 Units	This elective course provides a basis for solving problems in biomedical engineering through coding and computation. Coding structures applied to concepts in linear algebra, statistics, and probability are introduced as a foundation to more advanced biomedical data science applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The course is taught using Python; no prior knowledge of Python is expected or required. Students should be comfortable with high school level algebra and geometry. This course is required as prerequisite for BME440, Biomedical Data Science, and is a required course for the Biomedical Data Science minor.	"Annually / "	BME 220	null
